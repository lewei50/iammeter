## why we do this 

Although we have try to integrated more UI useful view in IAMMETER-cloud,it can not cover all requirements.
So we have make this project,you can easily develop and customize your own monitor view, only by JS code.

Ex:

- Plot all power values in one chart.
- Display the instant value in a different color when it exceeds the alarm value.
- ...

## who is this for

IAMMETER-cloud user, familiar with JavaScript, has extra monitor view requirements.
